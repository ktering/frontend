                <p className="mb-4">3.1.<strong> Vendor Responsibility</strong>: Vendors (Kterers) are
                    solely
                    responsible for the preparation, packaging, and timely delivery of homemade meals. They are expected
                    to follow food safety guidelines and maintain the quality of meals during transit.</p>
                <p className="mb-4">3.2. <strong>Consumer Expectations</strong>: Consumers should be present
                    at
                    the specified delivery location at the estimated delivery time to receive their orders. Failure to
                    do so may result in delays or compromised meal quality.</p>
                <p className="mb-4">3.3. <strong>Non-Delivery Situations</strong>: In rare instances where a
                    delivery cannot be completed due to reasons beyond the vendor's control (e.g., incorrect address,
                    unavailability of the customer), the vendor will make reasonable efforts to contact the customer.
                    However, the responsibility for missed deliveries in such situationâ€™s rests with the customer.</p>
